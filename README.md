# Database-construction-and-analysis-for-Tensorflow-and-Pytorch
For this project, we handled GitHub data for PyTorch and Tensorflow.  
We chose PostgreSQL as our DBMS, and Psycopg2 to simulate postgresql environment in Python

1. I cleant, manipulated, and structured data, and obtained a well-designed 
   dataset that complies with Postgresql. 
2. I provided valuable descriptive insights, which gives a set of 
   descriptive statistics that depicts some interesting trends or noteworthy 
   data characteristics.
3. I further performed an insightful data analysis. I analysed the modularity 
   of the source code and the features of issues getting the community's attention.
